            "Synthetic compounds have efficient the globe due to its vast applicable grounds. Precursors have been of specific enthusiasm to recognized experimenters because of their enormous parcels. Examine as well as their derivations are used as essential pharmacophores in field of drug. fierce investigation have been made with exceptional spotlight on purgative, antiulcerogenics,, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, mitigating, antiarthritic, antirheumatic, upper, fungicidal, insecticidal, cell reinforcement and antitumor effort of enaminones grounded deductions. Conservation of green complaint free terrain by using these derivations is being conceded in developed as well as developing countries of the world. Synthesized enaminones grounded derivations are the period of concern for experimenters due to their distinctive parcels. Owing to the remarkable conditioning of enaminones and their derivations, we synthesize composites having both functionalities and estimate their antibacterial exertion and antifungal operations. Proton and Carbon NMR, antimicrobial and antifungal ways were used for characterization and evaluation of recently synthesized enaminones. The result of these ways shows that our asked composites were successfully synthesized and have potent antibacterial and antifungal exertion.

These reactions emit a lot of heat, which is why they typically exhibit self-propagating and occasionally explosive behavior.

            "Enaminone synthesis from anline and its derivative with different dicarbonyl compound as a useful and efficient tool for the synthesis of diverse enaminone derivatives. The reactions proceed under mild conditions, with high selectivity and good yields, offering a greener and sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic routes. In the first method when the anline and its derivative react with the dicarbonyl compound at the presence of MeOH at high temperature than the 2,3-disubstitued enaminone was formed. In this reaction the DMSO used as a solvent and Cs2CO3 used as base. This reaction was completed in 3 hours under the microwave oven. In the second method the the synthesize 2,3-disubstituted enaminone with DMSO as the solvent and 1,10-phenanthroline as an additive for Cs2CO3 . In second method the the temperature of the reaction was decreased and the time for completing the reaction increased due to for the addition of the additive. In third method, CuI, DMSO as a solvent, Cs2CO3 as base without additive 2,3-disubtitued enaminone were prepared. Enaminones are recognized as a key building block for the creation of medicines, agrochemicals, material sciences, and fragrances. For more than a century, organic chemists had dedicated significant attention to the synthesis of enaminones, and numerous techniques for this process was established. But it was also observed that certain substitution patterns are still often hard to achieve using conventional enaminone-forming reactions, hence one of the ongoing major tasks in synthetic organic chemistry is to find novel approaches for the synthesis of enaminones. Here the synthesis of enaminones, can be described in one step.. The development of a gentle and adaptable process for enaminone synthesis appears to be necessary. Therefore,enaminone synthesis can be considered a promising area of research for the development of new and efficient methodologies for the synthesis of novel compounds.

            "An inert material that is transformed into an active one is called a precursor (such as an enzyme, vitamin, or hormone). Any chemical that is changed into another is referred to be a precursor (Charles & Patrick Jr, 2002). This substance takes part in a chemical reaction to create another substance. More precisely, it usually refers to a chemical substance that comes before another in a metabolic process, such a precursor of a protein.Precursors of various types, including drug, protein, and monoamine precursors, have contributed to the synthesis of numerous molecules and several fields of medicine and chemistry (Mengali et al., 2013). \n",
            "It has been discovered that precursor reactions based on metathetical (exchange) routes provide a productive synthetic approach for the synthesis of numerous compounds. These solid-solid reactions can frequently start at room temperature or just above it, and they happen very quickly typically in less than a second.{Harris, 1981 #104} They have the potential to be helpful in producing superior cationic or anionic solid solutions as well as in regulating the size of product particles. These reactions emit a lot of heat, which is why they typically exhibit self-propagating and occasionally explosive behavior. The optimal set of precursors can therefore be chosen with the use of thermodynamic considerations based on reaction enthalpies (Wiley & Kaner, 1992).\n",
            "1.1Enaminones\n",
            "Enaminones also well-known as enamines and their structures are multipurpose derivatives β-dicarbonyl compounds (Masocha, Kombian, & Edafiogho, 2016). The enaminones have a different capability because of its chemical nature used as multipurpose synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis, pharmaceutical development and heterocyclic synthesis (Gurowitz & Joseph, 1967). Enaminones are versatile readily obtainable novel reagents and their chemistry has considerable importance in recent years. \n",
            "Enaminone is used to indicate any compound containing the conjugated system N-C=C-C=O. It may be a mono-enamine of a lY3-diketone (vinylogous amide) or of a 3-keto-ester(vinylogous urethane). Designations sometimes used, such as enamino ketone or p-amino-a$-unsaturated ketone, are misleading in that as the compounds rarely show the physical or chemical properties normally associated with ketones (J. Greenhill, 1977).\n",
            "1.2 Importance of Enaminones\n",
            "Enaminones are a class of compounds that have been found to possess a wide range of importance including:\n",
            " Antimicrobial activity: Enaminones have shown activity against various bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, making them potential leads for the development of new antimicrobial drugs. Anticancer activity: Some enaminones have demonstrated cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, making them potential candidates for cancer treatment.\n",
            "Antiviral activity: Enaminones have shown activity against certain viruses, including HIV and herpesviruses. Inflammatory response modulation: Enaminones have been found to modulate the inflammatory response, which could be useful in treating conditions such as arthritis, asthma, and allergies. Neuroprotective activity: Some enaminones have shown potential in protecting against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Agricultural applications: Enaminones have been found to have herbicidal and fungicidal activity, making them potential leads for the development of new agrochemicals.Synthetic chemistry.\n",
            "\tEnaminones are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.Medicinal chemistry: Enaminones have been used as scaffolds for the design and synthesis of new drugs, including antibiotics, antivirals, and anticancer agents.Biosynthetic studies: The study of enaminone biosynthesis has led to a greater understanding of the enzymes and pathways involved in natural product biosynthesis. Drug discovery: Enaminones have been identified as potential leads for the treatment of various diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer.Overall, enaminones are an important class of compounds with a wide range of potential applications in medicine, agriculture, and synthetic chemistry.\n",
            "1.3 Structure of Enaminones\n",
            "Enaminones are synthetic mixtures made out of a carbonyl gathering and an amino gathering associated by a C=C bond. Furthermore, any substance having the formed framework N-C=C-C=O is shown by it. These versatile manufactured intermediates consolidate the encompassing eletrophilicity of enones with the surrounding nucleophilicity of enamines. (J. Greenhill, 1977). These are exemplary push-pull ethylenes, where electron thickness is moved by the amine bunch and pulled by the carbonyl.

            "Enaminone synthesis from anline and its derivative with different dicarbonyl compound as a useful and efficient tool for the synthesis of diverse enaminone derivatives. The reactions proceed under mild conditions, with high selectivity and good yields, offering a greener and sustainable alternative to traditional synthetic routes. In the first method when the anline and its derivative react with the dicarbonyl compound at the presence of MeOH at high temperature than the 2,3-disubstitued enaminone was formed. In this reaction the DMSO used as a solvent and Cs2CO3 used as base. This reaction was completed in 3 hours under the microwave oven. In the second method the the synthesize 2,3-disubstituted enaminone with DMSO as the solvent and 1,10-phenanthroline as an additive for Cs2CO3 . In second method the the temperature of the reaction was decreased and the time for completing the reaction increased due to for the addition of the additive. In third method, CuI, DMSO as a solvent, Cs2CO3 as base without additive 2,3-disubtitued enaminone were prepared. Enaminones are recognized as a key building block for the creation of medicines, agrochemicals, material sciences, and fragrances. For more than a century, organic chemists had dedicated significant attention to the synthesis of enaminones, and numerous techniques for this process was established. But it was also observed that certain substitution patterns are still often hard to achieve using conventional enaminone-forming reactions, hence one of the ongoing major tasks in synthetic organic chemistry is to find novel approaches for the synthesis of enaminones. Here the synthesis of enaminones, can be described in one step.. The development of a gentle and adaptable process for enaminone synthesis appears to be necessary. Therefore,enaminone synthesis can be considered a promising area of research for the development of new and efficient methodologies for the synthesis of novel compounds.
